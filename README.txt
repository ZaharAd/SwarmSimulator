This is a very simple Swarm Simulator I wrote a long time ago.

If I have some time, one day I will get back to this code and try to make more interesting stuff.

It uses Java Swing to create a visual swarm of "birds" (arrows really) that follow some very simple rules, which are basically:

- fly roughly in the same direction as most of your near neighbours.
- do not get too close to other birds.
- some birds are 'rebels' and will not care about others. Other birds tend to follow these.
